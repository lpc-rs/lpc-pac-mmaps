0x40008010 C   FIELD 04w01 LMS: Loopback Mode Select. The modem loopback mode provides a mechanism to perform diagnostic loopback testing. Serial data from the transmitter is connected internally to serial input of the receiver. Input pin, RXD, has no effect on loopback and output pin, TXD is held in marking state. The four modem inputs (CTS, DSR, RI and DCD) are disconnected externally. Externally, the modem outputs (RTS, DTR) are set inactive. Internally, the four modem outputs are connected to the four modem inputs. As a result of these connections, the upper four bits of the MSR will be driven by the lower four bits of the MCR rather than the four modem inputs in normal mode. This permits modem status interrupts to be generated in loopback mode by writing the lower four bits of MCR.
0x40008010 C   FIELD 05w01 RESERVED: Reserved, user software should not write ones to reserved bits. The value read from a reserved bit is not defined.

0x40008014 C   FIELD 01w01 OE: Overrun Error. The overrun error condition is set as soon as it occurs. A LSR read clears LSR[1]. LSR[1] is set when UART RSR has a new character assembled and the UART RBR FIFO is full. In this case, the UART RBR FIFO will not be overwritten and the character in the UART RSR will be lost.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 02w01 PE: Parity Error. When the parity bit of a received character is in the wrong state, a parity error occurs. A LSR read clears LSR[2]. Time of parity error detection is dependent on FCR[0]. Note: A parity error is associated with the character at the top of the UART RBR FIFO.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 03w01 FE: Framing Error. When the stop bit of a received character is a logic 0, a framing error occurs. A LSR read clears LSR[3]. The time of the framing error detection is dependent on FCR0. Upon detection of a framing error, the RX will attempt to re-synchronize to the data and assume that the bad stop bit is actually an early start bit. However, it cannot be assumed that the next received byte will be correct even if there is no Framing Error. Note: A framing error is associated with the character at the top of the UART RBR FIFO.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 04w01 BI: Break Interrupt. When RXD1 is held in the spacing state (all zeros) for one full character transmission (start, data, parity, stop), a break interrupt occurs. Once the break condition has been detected, the receiver goes idle until RXD1 goes to marking state (all ones). A LSR read clears this status bit. The time of break detection is dependent on FCR[0]. Note: The break interrupt is associated with the character at the top of the UART RBR FIFO.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 05w01 THRE: Transmitter Holding Register Empty. THRE is set immediately upon detection of an empty UART THR and is cleared on a THR write.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 06w01 TEMT: Transmitter Empty. TEMT is set when both THR and TSR are empty; TEMT is cleared when either the TSR or the THR contain valid data.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 07w01 RXFE: Error in RX FIFO. LSR[7] is set when a character with a RX error such as framing error, parity error or break interrupt, is loaded into the RBR. This bit is cleared when the LSR register is read and there are no subsequent errors in the UART FIFO.
0x40008014 C   FIELD 08w24 RESERVED: Reserved

0x40008030 C   FIELD 07w01 TXEN: When this bit is 1, as it is after a Reset, data written to the THR is output on the TXD pin as soon as any preceding data has been sent. If this bit cleared to 0 while a character is being sent, the transmission of that character is completed, but no further characters are sent until this bit is set again. In other words, a 0 in this bit blocks the transfer of characters from the THR or TX FIFO into the transmit shift register. Software can clear this bit when it detects that the a hardware-handshaking TX-permit signal (CTS) has gone false, or with software handshaking, when it receives an XOFF character (DC3). Software can set this bit again when it detects that the TX-permit signal has gone true, or when it receives an XON (DC1) character.
