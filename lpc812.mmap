0x14000000 A PERIPHERAL MTB
0x14000000 B  REGISTER POSITION (rw): POSITION Register
0x14000000 C   FIELD 02w01 WRAP (rw): This bit is set to 1 automatically when the POINTER value wraps as determined by the MASTER.MASK field in the MASTER Trace Control Register.
0x14000000 C   FIELD 03w29 POINTER (rw): Trace packet location pointer. Because a packet consists of two words, the POINTER field is the location of the first word of a packet. This field contains bits [31:3] of the address, in the SRAM, where the next trace packet will be written. The field points to an unused location and is automatically incremented. A debug agent can calculate the system address, on the AHB-Lite bus, of the SRAM location pointed to by the POSITION register using the following equation: system address = BASE + ((P + (2AWIDTH - (BASE MOD 2AWIDTH))) MOD 2AWIDTH). Where P = POSITION AND 0xFFFF_FFF8. Where BASE is the BASE register value
0x14000004 B  REGISTER MASTER (rw): MASTER Register
0x14000004 C   FIELD 00w05 MASK (rw): This value determines the maximum size of the trace buffer in SRAM. It specifies the most-significant bit of the POSITION.POINTER field that can be updated by automatic increment. If the trace tries to advance past this power of two, the POSITION.WRAP bit is set to 1, the POSITION.POINTER[MASK:0] bits are set to zero, and the POSITION.POINTER[AWIDTH-4:MASK+1] bits remain unchanged. This field causes the trace packet information to be stored in a circular buffer of size 2(MASK+4) bytes, that can be positioned in memory at multiples of this size. Valid values of this field are zero to AWIDTH-4. Values greater than the maximum have the same effect as the maximum.
0x14000004 C   FIELD 05w01 TSTARTEN (rw): Trace start input enable. If this bit is 1 and the TSTART signal is HIGH, then the EN bit is set to 1. Tracing continues until a stop condition occurs.
0x14000004 C   FIELD 06w01 TSTOPEN (rw): Trace stop input enable. If this bit is 1 and the TSTOP signal is HIGH, then the EN bit is set to 0. If a trace packet is being written to memory, the write is completed before tracing is stopped.
0x14000004 C   FIELD 07w01 SFRWPRIV (rw): Special Function Register Write Privilege bit. If this bit is 0, then User or Privileged AHB-Lite read and write accesses to the Special Function Registers are permitted.

0x14000004 C   FIELD 08w01 RAMPRIV (rw): SRAM Privilege bit. If this bit is 0, then User or Privileged AHB-Lite read and write accesses to the SRAM are permitted. If this bit is 1, then only Privileged AHB-Lite read and write accesses to the SRAM are permitted and User accesses are RAZ/WI. The HPROT[1] signal determines if an access is User or Privileged.
0x14000004 C   FIELD 09w01 HALTREQ (rw): Halt request bit. This bit is connected to the halt request signal of the trace logic, EDBGRQ. When HALTREQ is set to 1, EDBGRQ is asserted if DBGEN is also HIGH. The HALTREQ bit can be automatically set to 1 using the FLOW.WATERMARK field.
0x14000004 C   FIELD 31w01 EN (rw): Main trace enable bit. When this bit is 1 trace data is written into the SRAM memory location addressed by POSITION.POINTER. The POSITION.POINTER value auto increments after the trace data packet is written. The EN bit can be automatically set to 0 using the FLOW.WATERMARK field and the FLOW.AUTOSTOP bit. The EN bit is automatically set to 1 if the TSTARTEN bit is 1 and the TSTART signal is HIGH. The EN bit is automatically set to 0 if TSTOPEN bit is 1 and the TSTOP signal is HIGH.
0x14000008 B  REGISTER FLOW (rw): FLOW Register
0x14000008 C   FIELD 00w01 AUTOSTOP (rw): If this bit is 1 and WATERMARK is equal to POSITION.POINTER, then the MASTER.EN bit is automatically set to 0. This stops tracing.
0x14000008 C   FIELD 01w01 AUTOHALT (rw): If this bit is 1 and WATERMARK is equal to POSITION.POINTER, then the MASTER.HALTREQ bit is automatically set to 1. If the DBGEN signal is HIGH, the MTB asserts this halt request to the Cortex-M0+ processor by asserting the EDBGRQ signal.
0x14000008 C   FIELD 03w29 WATERMARK (rw): WATERMARK value. This field contains an address in the same format as the POSITION.POINTER field. When the POSITION.POINTER matches the WATERMARK field value, actions defined by the AUTOHALT and AUTOSTOP bits are performed.
0x1400000C B  REGISTER BASE (ro): Indicates where the SRAM is located in the processor memory map. This register is provided to enable auto discovery of the MTB SRAM location, by a debug agent.
0x1400000C C   FIELD 00w32 BASE (ro): The value provided is the value of the SRAMBASEADDR[31:0] signal.

0x40050004 C   FIELD 00w01 MSTPENDING (ro): Master Pending. Indicates that the Master is waiting to continue communication on the I2C-bus (pending) or is idle. When the master is pending, the MSTSTATE bits indicate what type of software service if any the master expects. This flag will cause an interrupt when set if, enabled via the INTENSET register. The MSTPENDING flag is not set when the DMA is handling an event (if the MSTDMA bit in the MSTCTL register is set). If the master is in the idle state, and no communication is needed, mask this interrupt.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 01w03 MSTSTATE (ro): Master State code. The master state code reflects the master state when the MSTPENDING bit is set, that is the master is pending or in the idle state. Each value of this field indicates a specific required service for the Master function. All other values are reserved. See Table 400 for details of state values and appropriate responses.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 04w01 MSTARBLOSS (rw): Master Arbitration Loss flag. This flag can be cleared by software writing a 1 to this bit. It is also cleared automatically a 1 is written to MSTCONTINUE.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 06w01 MSTSTSTPERR (rw): Master Start/Stop Error flag. This flag can be cleared by software writing a 1 to this bit. It is also cleared automatically a 1 is written to MSTCONTINUE.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 08w01 SLVPENDING (ro): Slave Pending. Indicates that the Slave function is waiting to continue communication on the I2C-bus and needs software service. This flag will cause an interrupt when set if enabled via INTENSET. The SLVPENDING flag is not set when the DMA is handling an event (if the SLVDMA bit in the SLVCTL register is set). The SLVPENDING flag is read-only and is automatically cleared when a 1 is written to the SLVCONTINUE bit in the SLVCTL register. The point in time when SlvPending is set depends on whether the I2C interface is in HSCAPABLE mode. See Section 25.7.2.2.2. When the I2C interface is configured to be HSCAPABLE, HS master codes are detected automatically. Due to the requirements of the HS I2C specification, slave addresses must also be detected automatically, since the address must be acknowledged before the clock can be stretched.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 09w02 SLVSTATE (ro): Slave State code. Each value of this field indicates a specific required service for the Slave function. All other values are reserved.

0x40050004 C   FIELD 11w01 SLVNOTSTR (ro): Slave Not Stretching. Indicates when the slave function is stretching the I2C clock. This is needed in order to gracefully invoke Deep Sleep or Power-down modes during slave operation. This read-only flag reflects the slave function status in real time.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 12w02 SLVIDX (ro): Slave address match Index. This field is valid when the I2C slave function has been selected by receiving an address that matches one of the slave addresses defined by any enabled slave address registers, and provides an identification of the address that was matched. It is possible that more than one address could be matched, but only one match can be reported here.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 14w01 SLVSEL (ro): Slave selected flag. SLVSEL is set after an address match when software tells the Slave function to acknowledge the address, or when the address has been automatically acknowledged. It is cleared when another address cycle presents an address that does not match an enabled address on the Slave function, when slave software decides to NACK a matched address, when there is a Stop detected on the bus, when the master NACKs slave data, and in some combinations of Automatic Operation. SLVSEL is not cleared if software NACKs data.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 15w01 SLVDESEL (rw): Slave Deselected flag. This flag will cause an interrupt when set if enabled via INTENSET. This flag can be cleared by writing a 1 to this bit.

0x40050004 C   FIELD 18w01 MONACTIVE (ro): Monitor Active flag. Indicates when the Monitor function considers the I 2C bus to be active. Active is defined here as when some Master is on the bus: a bus Start has occurred more recently than a bus Stop.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 19w01 MONIDLE (rw): Monitor Idle flag. This flag is set when the Monitor function sees the I2C bus change from active to inactive. This can be used by software to decide when to process data accumulated by the Monitor function. This flag will cause an interrupt when set if enabled via the INTENSET register. The flag can be cleared by writing a 1 to this bit.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 24w01 EVENTTIMEOUT (rw): Event Time-out Interrupt flag. Indicates when the time between events has been longer than the time specified by the TIMEOUT register. Events include Start, Stop, and clock edges. The flag is cleared by writing a 1 to this bit. No time-out is created when the I2C-bus is idle.
0x40050004 C   FIELD 25w01 SCLTIMEOUT (rw): SCL Time-out Interrupt flag. Indicates when SCL has remained low longer than the time specific by the TIMEOUT register. The flag is cleared by writing a 1 to this bit.

The bit is cleared when the transmitter becomes idle as the transfer comes to an end. Forcing an end of transfer in this manner causes any specified FRAME_DELAY and TRANSFER_DELAY to be inserted.
0x40058008 C   FIELD 08w01 MSTIDLE (ro): Master idle status flag. This bit is 1 whenever the SPI master function is fully idle. This means that the transmit holding register is empty and the transmitter is not in the process of sending data.
